I would like to take further analyse my RNAseq data. My plan is to take the DGE list I got already analysed and then perform a Go term analysis using the python package goatools.

Step 1. using pandas I need to clean up my DGE list for further analysis (remove NAs, seperate into up and down regulated genes etc)

Step 2. Using goatools I will look for go term enrichments

Step 3. Further sort and summarize the enriched GO terms (special for goatools)

Step 4. Visualize the results
